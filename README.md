## Brainfuck

> **Brainfuck**  is an  esoteric programming language  created in 1993 by Urban Müller.
Notable for its extreme minimalism, the language consists of only eight simple commands, a  data pointer and an instruction pointer. While it is fully  Turing complete it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers. Brainfuck requires one to break commands into microscopic steps.
